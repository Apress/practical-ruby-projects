*** Practical Ruby Projects: Ideas for the Eclectic Programmer ***

Each chapter's code is included in a separate directory. When
possible, a snapshot of the code is included for each revision
point. For example:

  Chapter02/music-1.rb
  Chapter02/music-2.rb
  etc.

Code can be run like this (with a few exceptions):

  ruby music-1.rb

I hope you find this code useful!
